This is a very simple starter project for creating a cross-platform desktop app using node-webkit, HTML5, Angular, and Bootstrap. The following versions are included in the repo:

- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) (v1.2.14)  
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) (v3.1.1)

The app was tested against:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (v0.11.9)
- [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) (v0.9.2) 


There are several ways to [package](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps) and [run the app](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/How-to-run-apps), but one way is to run the following from the root of the app (assuming node-webkit is in your path)
